    "\n",
    "Welcome to the quantum notebooks! \n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains a collection of quantum circuits and quantum algorithms in Python using [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/). Their goal is to provide a hands-on approach to quantum computing: on the Jupyter notebooks, you will find implementations of what is usually only discussed theoretically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the codes are paired with dicussions on my [blogs about quantum computing](https://ivaniscoding.github.io/tags/quantum/). The discussions on the blog try to build an intuition behind the codes discussed here, so I invite you to check them out. \n",
