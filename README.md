# Quantum [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.7+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.7.0/) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IvanIsCoding/Quantum/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

Welcome to the quantum notebooks! 

This repository contains a collection of quantum circuits and quantum algorithms in Python using [Qiskit](https://www.qiskit.org/). Their goal is to provide a hands-on approach to quantum computing: on the Jupyter notebooks, you will find implementations of what is usually only discussed theoretically.

To get started, it is easy: you can run the notebooks online on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/IvanIsCoding/Quantum/master?filepath=index.ipynb). No installation is required!

Lastly, the codes are paired with dicussions on my [blogs about quantum computing](https://ivaniscoding.github.io/tags/quantum/). The discussions on the blog try to build an intuition behind the codes discussed here, so I invite you to check them out.
