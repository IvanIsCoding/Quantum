    "# The Mathematics Behind Shor's Algorithm\n",

    "Shor's algorithm is an algorithm that can factorize big numbers quickly. For an integer $N$, Shor's algorithm can find a factor of it in $O((\\log_{} N)^{3})$ which is an almost exponential speedup over classical algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm brought a lot of interest into building quantum computers, because if an ideal quantum computer could be built, then the widely used public-key cryptography RSA scheme could be broken.\n",

    "## Classical part\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm is hybrid becasuse it mixes a classical part and a quantum part. In this notebook, we will discuss the mathematics behind the classical part and assume the quantum part as a black box. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we need to define what the algorithm does. It solves the factorization problem: given an intenger $N$, find two integers greater than one $P$ and $Q$ such that $PQ = N$, or state that $N$ is prime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we need to define what the input of the algorithm is: it is $N$, an odd integer that is neither a prime nor the power of a prime. These assumptions are necessary for the algorithm to work, and when they are not respected factorizing is still easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N$ is even, we can pick $P = 2$ and $Q = N/2$ so the even case is straightforward. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $N$ is prime, we can check with primality tests such as [Miller-Rabin's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%E2%80%93Rabin_primality_test) for primality in a reasonable time complexity so this case is also easier than solving general factorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $N$ is the power of a prime, we can check for every $2 \\leq k \\leq \\log_{3}N$ if $N^{1/k}$ is an integer. If it is, then $P = N^{1/k}$ and $Q = N^{(k-1)/k}$ is a solution and the case for powers of primes is solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are an implementation of a naive primality checking and the check for an exact power."

    "Why focus on the smallest $r$ if it is easy to find an arbitrary one that works (e.g. $\\phi(N)$)? The fact is that the smallest $r$ has a nice property that is key in our analysis. First, let's rewrite our equation:\n",

Notice that $N \\nmid (a^{r/2} - 1)$, because that would imply $a^{r/2} \\equiv 1$ and violate our condition that $r$ was the smallest. Thus, the prime factors of $N$ are distributed among $a^{r/2} - 1$ and $a^{r/2} + 1$.\n",

    "There are two cases. In the first one, we're out of luck: if $N \\mid (a^{r/2} + 1)$, then it might be that all the factors are on $a^{r/2} + 1$ and we can conclude nothing about the prime factorization of $N$.\n",

    "In the second case, $N \\nmid (a^{r/2} + 1)$ and we can make a conclusion: because $N$ divides the product but not the numbers individually, at least one of $\\gcd(N, a^{r/2} + 1)$ or $\\gcd(N, a^{r/2} - 1)$ will be a non trivial factor of $N$. Our factorization is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if finding $r$ is done quickly, we can try multiple values for $a$ until we found one that yields a factor. It can be shown that the probability that $a$ works is at least $1/2$, so with few attempts for $a$ we will find a factor. Shor's algorithm is concluded\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the math concepts behind Shor's algorithm, we can write the pseudo-code for the algorithm. Notice that in this step we are not worrying about the implementation of other parts of the algorithm: we assume that the classical parts of $\\gcd$, primality-testing, checking if the k-th root is an integer are implemented and available for use. We also assume that the quantum subroutine for period finding is available for use. This yields the code:"
